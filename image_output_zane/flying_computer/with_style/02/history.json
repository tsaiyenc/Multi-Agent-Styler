The texture is smooth with minimal visible brushwork, different from the rough shading of the reference.\n\n3. **Comparison**: The target image lacks the detailed line work and shading seen in the reference image, while the reference employs black and white contrast, added depth, and dimension through pencil textures. \n\n4. **Style Improvement Suggestions**: To approach the reference image's style, the target should incorporate more detailed line work, introduce varied shading for depth, and use a monochromatic palette to align with the sketch's realism."

The absence of shading and realistic representation in the target further distances it from the reference.\n\n4. **Style Improvement Suggestions**: To improve alignment with the reference image, the target should integrate more intricate line work, introduce varied shading techniques, and employ a monochromatic or limited color palette to enhance realism and detail, echoing the linearity and depth found in the reference sketch."
