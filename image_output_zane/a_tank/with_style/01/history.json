The content should align more closely with serene themes by removing the tank and soldiers, and instead incorporating peaceful elements such as architectural features or natural landscapes, which resonate with the tranquil essence of the Reference Image.The style should be improved by ensuring that the abstract background complements the tank rather than competes with it, potentially by adjusting the background's color contrast or integrating more subdued tones to enhance clarity. Additionally, more traditional stylistic elements aligned with a specific artistic movement could be incorporated for greater aesthetic coherence.\n\nThe content should include relevant contextual details such as military terrain features or debris to ground the tank within its environment. Moreover, the figures on the tank should be removed to keep the focus solely on the tank, reinforcing it as the main subject of the image."
