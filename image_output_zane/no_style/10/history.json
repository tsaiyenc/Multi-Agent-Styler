To improve the target image towards the Cubism style:\n- **Use a Wider Color Palette:** Integrate cooler tones and contrasting colors for harmony.\n- **Emphasize Fragmentation:** Break the forms into more abstract shapes to mimic the Cubist style.\n- **Refine Lighting:** Adopt a flatter lighting approach for depth consistency.\n- **Enhance Complexity:** Layer the composition with more visual elements to enhance asymmetry and depth.\n\nThis structured approach will create a closer alignment with the Cubist reference image."

The content should include more intricate background details to elevate the visual interest and complexity of the scene or remove any overly dramatic lighting that may distract from the overall Cubist aesthetic.The style should be improved by incorporating more dynamic and action-oriented elements that reflect a competitive theme, potentially through the use of bolder colors and motion-inspired techniques. Additionally, the composition should align more closely with traditional representations of boxing to enhance the theme. \n\nThe content should include a dog and a cat depicted in dynamic fighting poses, set within a boxing ring complete with ropes and possibly a referee. It is essential to remove the two stylized cats currently present, as they do not align with the specified description and context."
