This will enrich the composition and reflect the vibrancy seen in the reference image while ensuring the target image feels more cohesive with the Impressionistic style.The style should be improved by ensuring that the dynamic nature of the action is highlighted through stronger colors and a more engaging composition that conveys energy and excitement typical of action-themed images.
