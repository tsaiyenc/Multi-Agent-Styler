Improving tonal variation and line expressiveness would better capture the essence of the reference’s style."

The adjustments suggested involve:\n\n1. **Introduction of Gray Tones**: Incorporating a range of grays would elevate the target image's monochromatic palette, creating more depth and dimension consistent with the reference.\n\n2. **Enhancing Line Work**: Adopting a looser, more varied line style with differing thicknesses will contribute to a sketchy feeling that is prominent in contemporary urban sketches.\n\n3. **Dynamic Lighting and Shadows**: Intensifying contrast in lighting—particularly through shadowing techniques—can provide a three-dimensional effect, making the scene more engaging and representative of the reference's style.\n\nImplementing these refinements should significantly elevate the target image's alignment with the artistic style of the reference, potentially improving its current score substantially from the evaluated 2.61 out of 10."
