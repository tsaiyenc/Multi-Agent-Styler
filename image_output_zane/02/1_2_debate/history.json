This aligns with a contemporary or humorous art approach.\n\n2. **Target Image Analysis**:\n   - **Color Palette**: Both images utilize a similar muted color palette; however, the target image has a slightly broader and more varied range of colors.\n   - **Brushstroke/Texture**: The reference shows smoother, more consistent line work, while the target has some visible, rougher brush strokes, which can create an inconsistency in texture.\n   - **Lighting and Shadow**: The lighting in the reference is more balanced, creating a cohesive depth, while the target has uneven shadowing, making it feel less integrated.\n   - **Composition and Balance**: The reference image has a clearer focus and organized space in the boxing scene, whereas the target feels somewhat cluttered with figures.\n\n3. **Comparison**: The target image diverges from the reference in terms of texture and overall composition; it lacks the refined balance seen in the reference. To improve the score:\n   - Simplify the background to reduce distraction.\n   - Aim for smoother lines and consistent shadowing to enhance cohesion.\n  \n4. **Score Justification**: A score of 2.49/10 reflects significant divergence from the reference style. To improve, consider reducing visual clutter, ensuring consistent brushwork, and enhancing lighting effects for a more unified look."
