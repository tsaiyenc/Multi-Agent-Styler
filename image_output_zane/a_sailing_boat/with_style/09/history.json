The emotional expression in Impressionism often relies on color subtleties and brushwork to convey mood; the target currently leans toward a clear, structured aesthetic. Softening colors can evoke nostalgia or tranquility.\n2. These adjustments might shift the thematic content from a bold, confident representation to a more ethereal, fleeting moment, capturing a more traditional Impressionist essence."
