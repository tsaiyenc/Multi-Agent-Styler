The subjects and their interactions also diverge greatly.\n\n4. **Score Justification**: A score of 7.38 suggests a significant alignment with certain aspects of the Academic Realism style, yet noticeable divergence in color usage and texture. \n\n**Improvement Suggestions**: To align the target image more closely with the reference's style, consider:\n- Introduce warmer tones to create a more inviting palette.\n- Enhance brush texture for a more dynamic feel.\n- Incorporate more contrast in lighting to mimic the dramatic effects present in the reference."

The content should include additional human figures or intimate scenes that reflect interaction and narrative, which are central to Academic Realism, or remove the maritime elements to align more closely with the thematic focus of the reference image.The style should be improved by ensuring a more cohesive representation that aligns with a specific artistic movement, such as enhancing color harmony, brushwork, and texture to match the desired style more closely. Additionally, introducing elements that evoke a stronger emotional response or thematic representation could elevate the overall aesthetic impact of the image.\n\nThe content should include clearer wave patterns and sunlight reflections on the water to enhance the maritime atmosphere, while also removing the smaller boats on the left side to focus attention on the central sailing boat, thus creating a more defined focal point in the composition."
