The sailing boats do align with the described content, but the simplicity doesn't capture the essence of Cubism. \n2. The image may need modifications to avoid redundancy and increase dynamism in the shapes.\n3. Additional overlapping elements could indeed enhance depth and align better with Cubist artistry.\n\nGiven these insights, would it be helpful to suggest removing some simpler shapes while incorporating more complex geometries and perhaps enhancing the color contrasts further to create a more dynamic depiction that aligns with both Cubist style and the content requirements?"
