Should they be faded or simplified to ensure the focus remains on the sailing boats, or do you think enhancing the details of one of the buildings could add context?\n\n3. **Dynamic Elements for Engagement**: In terms of adding action or emotion, are there specific details like wind direction influencing the sails or seabirds that could elevate the scene's dynamism and overall appeal?\n\nYour clarifications will guide the next image iteration and help improve its alignment with the desired context."

Additionally, stronger contrast and lighting on the boats could help them stand out more prominently. \n\nFor the content, the image should include only the sailing boats as the primary focus, removing the human figures in the foreground to eliminate redundancy.
