What specific elements of the bold color palette in the target image detract from its alignment with the Academic Realism style, as evidenced by the reference image?\n2. Could you elaborate on how the use of sharp, defined edges affects the overall perception of this image in terms of style, and what adjustments could enhance the Academic Realism feel?\n3.

To improve alignment with Academic Realism, consider using a more muted palette with softer transitions between colors.\n\n2. **Brushstroke/Texture**: The sharp, defined edges in the target create a rigid feeling that detracts from the fluidity typical of Academic Realism. Soften the brushwork by incorporating smoother transitions and blending to enhance realism.\n\n3. **Composition and Emotional Tone**: The dynamic and humorous composition of the target can be adjusted by incorporating more formal poses and arrangements that evoke a sense of balance and serenity, similar to the reference image.

Can you provide examples of brushstroke techniques or methods that would effectively soften the transitions in the target image to better capture the essence of Academic Realism?\n3.

This can involve layering thin, transparent paint to gradually build depth, contrasting the sharp edges present in the target image.\n\n3. **Composition Suggestions**: Introduce more formal poses by depicting the figures in relaxed yet composed postures. For instance, consider repositioning characters in both images to align harmoniously, similar to the formal arrangements in the reference image's setting."
