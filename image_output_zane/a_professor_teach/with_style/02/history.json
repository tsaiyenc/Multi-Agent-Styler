Considering the objective style score of 3.51, what specific adjustments would make the target image's style more closely match the reference image's style? \n\nYour further elaboration on these points will help us refine the next image generation process."

Emphasizing rough textures and loose lines is vital to capturing its sketch-like quality.\n\n2. **Specific Adjustments for Improvement**:\n   - **Texture Enhancement**: Introduce more visible pencil strokes and shading in the target to replicate the rough texture of the reference image. \n   - **Simplified Elements**: Reduce clutter in the target's background to achieve a focused composition similar to the reference.\n   - **Lighting and Contrast**: Increase the contrast between light and shadows in the target to reflect the depth seen in the reference's shading, thereby enhancing the overall definition. \n\nImplementing these adjustments could boost the target's style closer to that of the reference, potentially improving its score significantly."

However, it introduces more complex character interactions and emotional expressions that diverge from the reference's straightforward urban scene.\n\n2. **Redundant or Distracting Elements**: The lower section of the target, featuring close-up facial expressions, might distract from the primary urban narrative. Simplifying or merging this section with a more seamless background could better focus on the central theme and enhance overall coherence with the reference image's straightforward approach.\n\nThese adjustments would help strengthen content alignment and improve the visual storytelling in the target image."
