To improve, consider adding more visible shading and depth to enhance texture and contrast, thus bringing it closer to the reference's academic realism."

Here's a summary of actionable adjustments:\n\n1. **Incorporate Varied Line Weights**: Use a mix of thinner and thicker lines to create more intricate details within the texture, reflecting the detailed pen work of academic realism.\n\n2. **Enhance Light and Shadow Contrast**: Add darker shadows and brighter highlights to the Target Image, which will help establish depth and dimension akin to the nuanced lighting observed in the Reference Image.\n\n3. **Refine Central Figure Details**: Improve the depiction of the central figure by emphasizing details in posture and clothing. Adding intricate folds and textures will contribute to a more realistic portrayal and align it better with the academic realism style.\n\nWith these enhancements, the Target Image can better match the high-scoring style, so it resonates more with the academic realism associated with the Reference Image.

        "content": "1. **Reference Image's Style**: The reference image is representative of Academic Realism, displayed through detailed linear work and a subdued color palette typical of pencil drawings.\n\n2. **Target Image Analysis**:\n   - **Color Palette**: The target image maintains a muted color palette similar to the reference, primarily in grayscale.\n   - **Brushstroke/Texture**: The texture in the target image is smoother, lacking the defined details present in the reference.\n   - **Lighting and Shadow**: While both images exhibit soft lighting, the target lacks the depth in shadow that enhances the dimensionality found in the reference.\n   - **Composition and Balance**: The target features a central figure with a clear focus, while the reference exhibits a broader architectural context.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - Similarities exist in the overall muted color scheme, but the target could benefit from greater detail and texture to match the drawing style of the reference.\n   - The lighting in the reference adds subtle gradation, which enhances the sense of depth not fully realized in the target.\n\n4. **Score Justification**: Given the score of 8.72/10, the target is largely aligned with the expected style, but enhancing texture and shadow depth would elevate its realism. To improve, add more details to the figure's clothing and increase shadow contrast to achieve a closer alignment to the reference's style."
