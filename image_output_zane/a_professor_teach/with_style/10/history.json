This could involve positioning shapes in such a way that some sit in front of or behind others, as seen in the reference image with its vase and table.\n\n2. **Color Palette:**\n   - Integrate a broader range of hues, specifically incorporating more muted tones alongside bold colors. This adjustment may help reflect the chiaroscuro effects often found in Cubist art and achieve a greater sense of depth.\n\n3. **Geometric Forms:**\n   - Mirror the geometric layering present in the reference image. For example, the way shapes interact in the depiction of the vase and table could serve as a guide for structuring the forms in the target image.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the target image could significantly improve in capturing the essence of the Cubist style, ideally enhancing its score in future evaluations."
