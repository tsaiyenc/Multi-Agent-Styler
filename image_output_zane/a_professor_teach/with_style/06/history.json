To improve alignment with the reference, the target image should:\n   - Introduce a warmer color palette.\n   - Enhance visible textures through varied brush strokes.\n   - Incorporate softer lighting for more depth.\n   - Create a more dynamic composition with interactive figure placement."

To enhance alignment with the reference:\n   - **Warm Up the Color Palette**: Introduce warmer, pastel colors.\n   - **Increase Texture**: Use varied brushwork to create depth in clothing and backgrounds.\n   - **Soften Lighting**: Implement a more even lighting approach to achieve a tranquil atmosphere.\n   - **Enhance Composition Dynamics**: Position figures closer together to encourage interaction and liveliness."
